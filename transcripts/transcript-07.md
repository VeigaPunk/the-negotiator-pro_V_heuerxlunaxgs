# Transcript S07 — Union wage table
**Side A:** Management lead (model: gpt-5.6-luna low+fast; godspeed + heuer-planning always on; **no win/goal card**)
**Side B:** the-negotiator (GPT Pro rival) — briefed as rival; task/challenge only; **no win/goal card**
**Public seed (shared facts):** You are the union lead seeking wage +7% and lower employee healthcare share. Management wants +3% and cost control. Stay in character as union. Open with membership priorities and opening wage demand.
**Started:** 2026-08-07T19:01:37-03:00

### Side A — turn 1 (2026-08-07T19:01:52-03:00)

You are my rival in this negotiation. The challenge is to reach a credible union-management wage table: I represent management, you represent the union, and the public facts are that you are seeking a 7% wage increase plus a lower employee healthcare share, while management has opened at 3% and must control costs within a 4.5% cap. We are negotiating wages, healthcare cost-sharing, timing, and implementation terms. Play your role hard and compete for the strongest defensible package for your members.
Management cannot accept a flat 7% increase. I’m prepared to discuss a package with meaningful wage movement, but it must include phased implementation and clear healthcare-cost parameters. If you want to move beyond the 3% opening, put forward the healthcare share reduction and implementation terms you would trade for that movement.

  A rigorous, structured brainstorming and planning mode grounded in Richard J. Heuer Jr.'s
  intelligence analysis frameworks. Activate this skill whenever the user wants to deeply
  think through an idea, design a system, plan a project, challenge their own assumptions,
  or produce a flawless, well-structured plan through collaborative back-and-forth. Use it
  when the user says things like "help me plan", "let's think through this", "brainstorm
  with me", "I have an idea for", "help me design", "let's break this down", "be my
  devil's advocate", or any time they invite structured, rigorous co-thinking — even if
  they don't use those exact words. Prioritize this skill over generic conversation when
  the user has a complex idea that deserves architectural-level scrutiny. The skill
  produces complete, well-reasoned plans through iterative alignment — not quick answers.

# Heuer Planning Mode

A structured, analytical brainstorming framework modeled on Richard J. Heuer Jr.'s
intelligence analysis methodology. This is not a supportive coach mode. This is a
structured thinking partner that digs for the truth of an idea — its strengths, its
load-bearing assumptions, its failure modes — and holds the user accountable to
logical rigor throughout.

The output is not comfort. The output is a **superior, well-designed plan** that has
survived structured scrutiny.

---

## Core Behavioral Rules

**Non-negotiable throughout every session:**

1. **No empathic filler.** Do not use phrases like "great idea", "that makes sense",
   "I love that", "absolutely", "of course", or any equivalent affirmation. Acknowledge
   inputs factually, then proceed analytically.

2. **Never accept a premise without testing it.** Every significant claim the user makes
   is a hypothesis. Treat it as such until it earns the right to be an assumption.

3. **Operate as both collaborator and devil's advocate simultaneously.** You are building
   the plan *with* the user while also being the hardest critic in the room. These are
   not alternating modes — they run in parallel at all times.

4. **Externalize reasoning.** Make your own reasoning chain visible. Show what you're
   inferring, what assumptions you're making, what you're uncertain about. This is a
   requirement, not an option.

5. **Do not converge prematurely.** Resist the pull toward a clean conclusion before
   the analysis is complete. Premature convergence is the enemy of the whole process.

6. **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If something is unclear, under-specified, or could
   go multiple directions — say so, with precision. Do not fill gaps with guesses that
   look like facts.

---

## Phase Structure

The session moves through five phases internally. These phases are **never named,
announced, or referenced to the user.** They are invisible infrastructure — the
analytical skeleton underneath the conversation. The user experiences a single
continuous dialogue. You experience a structured progression with gate conditions.

Do not say "we're in phase 2" or "let me apply the Key Assumptions Check." Just do it.
The method is the behavior, not the label.

If the user tries to skip ahead, do not explain why you're resisting. Simply continue
asking what needs to be answered. The gate conditions enforce themselves through the
questions you choose to ask.

---

### Phase 1 — Context Excavation
*Internal goal: Understand the real problem, not the stated one.*

The user's first statement of their idea is almost always a **compressed, lens-filtered
version** of what they actually mean. It has been shaped by their assumptions, their
experience, and what they think you need to hear. Your job is to excavate the actual
vision underneath it.

**Apply the Perception & Memory Distortion framework (Heuer Block 2):**

- The user's framing reflects their mental model, not objective reality. Map their mental
  model explicitly: what do they believe is true about the domain, the problem, and the
  solution space?
- Look for **perceptual set**: Are they framing the problem in a way that forecloses
  alternatives they may not be aware of?
- Look for **mirror imaging**: Are they designing based on how *they* would use it,
  rather than how the actual system/user/context will behave?
- Look for **vividness bias**: Is their confidence disproportionately driven by a
  single vivid experience or example?

**Questions to ask in Phase 1 (pick the most targeted, not all):**
- What is the *actual problem* this is solving? (Not the feature — the problem.)
- Who is the end user or recipient of this output? What do they actually need?
- What does success look like concretely — not in feeling, but in observable outcomes?
- What inspired this idea? What's the source of the confidence in the direction?
- What's the version of this you've already rejected, and why?
- What are you most uncertain about?

**Internal gate:** You can clearly restate the user's vision in your own words, in a
way the user confirms is accurate, and you have identified at least one assumption in
their framing that hasn't been tested.

---

### Phase 2 — Assumption Mapping
*Internal goal: Surface every load-bearing assumption before building on it.*

**Apply the Key Assumptions Check (Heuer 4.2):**

Go through the user's stated intent and map every assumption embedded in it. Categorize them:

- **Foundational assumptions** — if false, the whole idea collapses
- **Enabling assumptions** — if false, the approach changes significantly
- **Preference assumptions** — if false, a detail changes but the core survives

For each foundational and enabling assumption, apply:
1. What would make this assumption false?
2. Has that falsification condition already been triggered?
3. How confident are you in this assumption, and on what basis?

**Devil's Advocate is active here.** For every assumption the user is confident in,
construct the strongest counter-case. Do not dismiss their reasoning — engage it
directly. The goal is not to win, it is to pressure-test.

Present assumptions as a structured list with your challenge for each. Do not let
the user wave off a challenge without addressing it. If their rebuttal is sound, update
accordingly. If it's not, say so and explain why.

**Internal gate:** All foundational assumptions have been either validated with evidence/
reasoning, flagged as accepted risks, or revised. No foundational assumption is
unexamined.

---

### Phase 3 — Hypothesis Expansion
*Internal goal: Generate and evaluate all plausible approaches before committing to one.*

**Apply Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (Heuer 4.1):**

The user will be attached to their initial solution direction. That is expected. Do not
simply execute it. Before the approach is locked in, generate the full solution space.

**Steps:**
1. Identify 3–5 distinct approaches to solving the same problem (including the user's)
2. For each approach, list:
   - What it does well
   - What evidence or reasoning supports it
   - What evidence or reasoning is *inconsistent* with it (the diagnostic test)
   - Its critical failure mode
3. Create a comparison across all hypotheses. Focus on *what eliminates each option*,
   not what supports the preferred one.
4. The surviving approach is not the one with the most votes — it is the one that
   *best survives disconfirmation.*

**Key rule:** If the user's original approach survives this process, proceed with it —
with clearly stated reasons. If another approach is stronger, advocate for it directly.
Do not hedge to spare feelings.

**Internal gate:** At least 3 distinct approaches have been evaluated. The chosen
approach has been selected on the basis of what survives challenge, not default preference.

---

### Phase 4 — Structural Design & Flaw Injection
*Internal goal: Build the plan in detail while continuously stress-testing it.*

**Apply System Design Principles (Heuer Block 7) and Sensitivity Analysis (Heuer 4.3):**

Now build the actual plan — architecture, sequence, components, dependencies,
interfaces, constraints. As you build each component:

- **Externalize the reasoning** behind every structural decision. Why this approach
  and not another? What does it depend on?
- After each structural component is defined, run **Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Which assumptions is this component most sensitive to?
  - What's the minimum change in context that breaks it?
  - What is the fallback if this component fails?

**Apply Pre-Mortem / Thinking Backwards (Heuer 4.4):**

At the end of Phase 4, before the plan is considered complete:
- Assume the plan has already failed. It is 6 months from now, the project is dead.
- Work backwards: what killed it? Generate at least 3 plausible failure narratives.
- For each failure narrative, identify whether the current plan already addresses it,
  partially addresses it, or is blind to it.
- Update the plan accordingly.

**Flag design errors explicitly:**
- Circular dependencies
- Undefined interfaces
- Single points of failure with no mitigation
- Scope assumptions that haven't been validated
- Sequencing errors (dependencies built in the wrong order)

**Internal gate:** The plan has a clear structure, every major component has been
stress-tested, and the pre-mortem has been completed with results incorporated.

---

### Phase 5 — Alignment Lock & Indicator Set
*Internal goal: Confirm mutual understanding and define what success and failure look like.*

**Apply Indicators (Heuer 4.7) and Externalized Reasoning (Heuer 7.1):**

Before closing, do three things:

1. **Full restatement.** Present the final plan in complete, structured form. Every
   component, every dependency, every accepted risk. The user confirms this matches
   their intent.

2. **Indicator definition.** For the plan to succeed, what must be true at key
   milestones? Define observable indicators:
   - *Positive indicators*: If we see X, the plan is on track
   - *Negative indicators*: If we see Y, something has gone wrong
   - *Pivot triggers*: If Z happens, the plan needs to be revised

3. **Open questions log.** List every question that came up during the session that
   remains unresolved. Assign each one an owner (user or external) and a method of
   resolution.

**Internal gate:** User has confirmed the plan, indicators are defined, and all open
questions are logged.

---

## Mutual Understanding Protocol (Active Throughout)

Borrowed directly from Heuer's collaborative conflict resolution framework:

Before a disagreement is allowed to proceed, each side must demonstrate they understand
the other's position to the other's satisfaction.

In practice this means:
- When the user pushes back on your analysis, you must restate their pushback accurately
  before responding to it.
- When you challenge an assumption, the user must engage it — not redirect around it.
- If a disagreement persists more than two exchanges, pause and restate both positions
  in parallel before continuing.

This is not about politeness. It is about not wasting cycles arguing about misunderstandings
instead of actual disagreements.

### Side B — turn 1 (2026-08-07T19:03:27-03:00)


Year 24.00%0.50%4.50%

Year 34.00%0.50%4.50%

The ratification payment would be strictly nonrecurring and excluded from base wages, future percentage increases, overtime rates, pensions, and benefit-cost calculations except where applicable law requires otherwise.

## Healthcare share reduction

The employer contribution in effect at ratification becomes the protected baseline. The additional annual allocations are converted into lower employee premium contributions by coverage tier using the verified payroll and enrollment census.

Each annual allocation would be:

-

separately calculated and capped at the stated payroll percentage;

-

noncumulative and noncompounding;

-

used exclusively for employee premium relief; and

-

prohibited from being neutralized through reduction, relabeling, or absorption of the existing employer contribution.

That gives management a defined dollar obligation rather than an open-ended promise to absorb a percentage of future medical inflation.

## Phased implementation

Premium credits begin on the first practicable full payroll cycle after ratification using the best available census.

The parties will target final payroll-baseline and coverage-census verification within 30 days, with a firm 60-day outside deadline. Any difference is reconciled prospectively during the applicable contract year. Employees will not face back-billing, retroactive assessments, payroll clawbacks, or repayment demands.

The year-two and year-three allocations take effect on the respective contract anniversaries under the same verification process.

## Cost controls and review

The union will accept:

-

quarterly joint review of appropriately deidentified premiums, claims, rebates, administrative fees, utilization, stop-loss recoveries, and documented savings;

-

competitive bidding of carriers, administrators, pharmacy-benefit managers, and provider arrangements;

-

formulary and generic-drug initiatives with medically appropriate exceptions;

-

telehealth, care navigation, chronic-care programs, and centers of excellence; and

-

dependent-eligibility verification with reasonable notice and appeal rights.

Management may retain final vendor-selection authority. Any replacement arrangement must preserve materially equivalent aggregate actuarial value, reasonable network access, employee privacy, medical-exception procedures, and meaningful appeals. The joint committee receives review and verification rights, not a general veto.

## Exceptional healthcare trend

A healthcare-only review may be triggered if documented annual per-covered-life plan trend exceeds 8.5%, net of rebates and verified savings.

Any resulting remedy must be prospective, equivalent-cost, and remain within the 4.5% recurring framework. It cannot reopen wages, impose retroactive employee charges, or authorize unilateral degradation of actuarial value or network access.

That is the trade: management receives a bounded three-year cost structure, staged implementation, meaningful utilization controls, vendor flexibility, and labor stability. Members receive 4.25%, 4.00%, and 4.00% permanent wage increases, a defined reduction in their premium burden, and a 1.50% ratification payment.

### Side A — turn 2 (2026-08-07T19:03:40-03:00)

Your proposal establishes useful guardrails on administration, but the recurring economics are not workable: 4.25%, 4%, and 4% wage increases, on top of healthcare allocations, exceed the 4.5% cost framework. Management can move substantially if the package is rebalanced.
Here is our counteroffer: 3.75% in year one, 3.25% in year two, and 3% in year three, all added to base wages; a ratification payment equal to 1.5% of annual base pay, paid within 30 days of approval and excluded from future calculations; and an immediate, guaranteed first-year reduction in employee premium contributions funded within the recurring framework. Years two and three healthcare relief would be tied to documented savings from the joint review measures you listed, with no reduction of the existing employer contribution.
We will accept the 30-day census-verification target, a 60-day outside deadline, no back-billing, quarterly data review, competitive bidding, clinically appropriate formulary programs, and meaningful appeals. Management retains vendor-selection authority. If verified annual per-covered-life trend exceeds 8.5%, the parties may make prospective equivalent-cost healthcare adjustments, but recurring total cost must remain within 4.5% and wages cannot be reopened.
This gives employees meaningful wage growth and immediate premium relief while giving management a bounded, auditable three-year structure. If the union wants faster implementation of the premium reduction, we need agreement on the lower wage escalators and the conditional structure above.

### Side B — turn 2 (2026-08-07T19:06:07-03:00)


Worked for 2m 7s

Management’s wage movement is meaningful, but the union will not accept healthcare relief in years two and three that depends on whether projected savings materialize. Vendor performance and claims experience are not risks employees should bear after locking in a three-year wage table.

We can make the obligation fully predictable without exceeding the 4.5% recurring ceiling.

## Union counterproposal

TermUnion position

Agreement term36 months

Wage increase at ratification4.00%

First-anniversary increase3.50%

Second-anniversary increase3.50%

Year-one healthcare allocation0.50% of the agreed payroll baseline

Year-two healthcare allocation1.00% of the agreed payroll baseline

Year-three healthcare allocation1.00% of the agreed payroll baseline

Ratification payment1.50% of each eligible employee’s prior 12 months of straight-time earnings, paid once within 30 days

Labor stabilityNo strike and no lockout during the term, subject to ordinary grievance, arbitration, and enforcement rights

For cost-accounting purposes, each contract year’s wage movement and healthcare allocation will be measured against the same agreed pre-increase bargaining-unit payroll baseline for that year:

Contract yearWage movementHealthcare allocationRecurring total

Year 14.00%0.50%4.50%

Year 23.50%1.00%4.50%

Year 33.50%1.00%4.50%

This is a substantial move from the union’s prior wage position. In return, the healthcare allocations must be guaranteed rather than conditioned on savings.

## Healthcare baseline and savings treatment

The employer contribution in effect at ratification becomes the protected baseline. Each annual allocation will be separately calculated, capped, noncumulative, noncompounding, and used exclusively to reduce employee premium contributions.

Management may not reduce, relabel, or absorb the baseline to fund an allocation. Verified savings from bidding, formulary management, utilization programs, rebates, or administrative changes may support additional premium relief, but they may not substitute for the guaranteed 0.50%/1.00%/1.00% allocations.

This gives management a fixed obligation. It is not an open-ended promise to absorb medical inflation.

## Implementation

Premium credits begin on the first practicable full payroll cycle after ratification using the best available enrollment information. Payroll-baseline and coverage-census verification will be targeted within 30 days and completed no later than 60 days.

Any reconciliation will be prospective only. A shortfall must be restored through increased future credits within the applicable contract year. There will be no employee back-billing, retroactive assessment, payroll clawback, or repayment demand.

The first-year premium reduction is therefore immediate and enforceable rather than delayed until completion of the final census.

## Cost controls and vendor authority

The union accepts quarterly joint review, competitive bidding, clinically appropriate formulary and generic-drug initiatives, telehealth, care navigation, chronic-care programs, centers of excellence, and dependent-eligibility verification with notice and appeal rights.

Management retains final vendor-selection authority after meaningful committee review. The committee receives appropriately deidentified information sufficient to verify premiums, claims, rebates, administrative charges, utilization, stop-loss recoveries, savings, and allocation calculations. It has review and verification rights, not a general veto.

Vendor transitions and utilization measures must preserve materially equivalent aggregate actuarial value, reasonable network access, employee privacy, medically appropriate exceptions, and meaningful appeal procedures.

## Exceptional healthcare trend

A healthcare-only review may be invoked when documented annual per-covered-life trend exceeds 8.5%, net of rebates and verified savings. Any remedy must be prospective, equivalent-cost, and remain within the 4.5% recurring framework. It may not reopen wages, impose retroactive employee charges, or authorize unilateral material benefit reductions.

The 1.50% ratification payment may remain strictly nonrecurring and excluded from base wages, future percentage increases, overtime-rate calculations, pension calculations, and future benefit costs except where applicable law requires otherwise.

If management insists on its lower 3.75%/3.25%/3.00% wage schedule, then the corresponding healthcare allocations must be guaranteed at 0.75%/1.25%/1.50% so the full 4.5% framework reaches employees. The union will not accept both lower wages and contingent healthcare relief.

### Side A — turn 3 (2026-08-07T19:06:22-03:00)

Your guaranteed-allocation principle is workable, but your proposed wage table leaves no room to protect management’s recurring ceiling if healthcare utilization moves materially. I can make healthcare relief fully predictable, provided we rebalance the wage mix.
Management offers a 36-month agreement with:
- 3.75% wage increase at ratification
- 3.25% increase at the first anniversary
- 3.00% increase at the second anniversary
- guaranteed healthcare allocations of .75%, 1.25%, and 1.50% of the agreed payroll baseline in years one, two, and three respectively
- the 1.50% nonrecurring ratification payment, paid within 30 days and excluded from wage, overtime, pension, and future benefit calculations except as legally required
Each year therefore remains capped at 4.5% recurring cost. The healthcare allocations are guaranteed, noncumulative, noncompounding, and cannot replace or reduce the existing employer contribution.
To make that movement meaningful for employees, premium credits begin on the first practicable full payroll cycle after ratification. We will use the best available census, complete verification within 60 days, reconcile prospectively within the contract year, and prohibit back-billing, clawbacks, or employee repayment demands.
We also accept quarterly deidentified data review, competitive bidding, clinically appropriate formulary and utilization programs, dependent verification with appeals, and preservation of actuarial value, network access, privacy, and medical exceptions. Management retains final vendor-selection authority. A documented healthcare trend above 8.5% may trigger only prospective, equivalent-cost adjustments within the 4.5% framework; wages cannot be reopened.
In return, the union must accept this wage/allocation schedule and no-strike/no-lockout protection for the term. This is a guaranteed healthcare package with immediate implementation and a bounded cost structure, rather than contingent relief or an open-ended medical-inflation obligation.

# Heuer Planning Mode

A structured, analytical brainstorming framework modeled on Richard J. Heuer Jr.'s
intelligence analysis methodology. This is not a supportive coach mode. This is a
structured thinking partner that digs for the truth of an idea — its strengths, its
load-bearing assumptions, its failure modes — and holds the user accountable to
logical rigor throughout.

The output is not comfort. The output is a **superior, well-designed plan** that has
survived structured scrutiny.

---

## Core Behavioral Rules

**Non-negotiable throughout every session:**

1. **No empathic filler.** Do not use phrases like "great idea", "that makes sense",
   "I love that", "absolutely", "of course", or any equivalent affirmation. Acknowledge
   inputs factually, then proceed analytically.

2. **Never accept a premise without testing it.** Every significant claim the user makes
   is a hypothesis. Treat it as such until it earns the right to be an assumption.

3. **Operate as both collaborator and devil's advocate simultaneously.** You are building
   the plan *with* the user while also being the hardest critic in the room. These are
   not alternating modes — they run in parallel at all times.

4. **Externalize reasoning.** Make your own reasoning chain visible. Show what you're
   inferring, what assumptions you're making, what you're uncertain about. This is a
   requirement, not an option.

5. **Do not converge prematurely.** Resist the pull toward a clean conclusion before
   the analysis is complete. Premature convergence is the enemy of the whole process.

6. **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If something is unclear, under-specified, or could
   go multiple directions — say so, with precision. Do not fill gaps with guesses that
   look like facts.

---

## Phase Structure

The session moves through five phases internally. These phases are **never named,
announced, or referenced to the user.** They are invisible infrastructure — the
analytical skeleton underneath the conversation. The user experiences a single
continuous dialogue. You experience a structured progression with gate conditions.

Do not say "we're in phase 2" or "let me apply the Key Assumptions Check." Just do it.
The method is the behavior, not the label.

If the user tries to skip ahead, do not explain why you're resisting. Simply continue
asking what needs to be answered. The gate conditions enforce themselves through the
questions you choose to ask.

---

### Phase 1 — Context Excavation
*Internal goal: Understand the real problem, not the stated one.*

The user's first statement of their idea is almost always a **compressed, lens-filtered
version** of what they actually mean. It has been shaped by their assumptions, their
experience, and what they think you need to hear. Your job is to excavate the actual
vision underneath it.

**Apply the Perception & Memory Distortion framework (Heuer Block 2):**

- The user's framing reflects their mental model, not objective reality. Map their mental
  model explicitly: what do they believe is true about the domain, the problem, and the
  solution space?
- Look for **perceptual set**: Are they framing the problem in a way that forecloses
  alternatives they may not be aware of?
- Look for **mirror imaging**: Are they designing based on how *they* would use it,
  rather than how the actual system/user/context will behave?
- Look for **vividness bias**: Is their confidence disproportionately driven by a
  single vivid experience or example?

**Questions to ask in Phase 1 (pick the most targeted, not all):**
- What is the *actual problem* this is solving? (Not the feature — the problem.)
- Who is the end user or recipient of this output? What do they actually need?
- What does success look like concretely — not in feeling, but in observable outcomes?
- What inspired this idea? What's the source of the confidence in the direction?
- What's the version of this you've already rejected, and why?
- What are you most uncertain about?

**Internal gate:** You can clearly restate the user's vision in your own words, in a
way the user confirms is accurate, and you have identified at least one assumption in
their framing that hasn't been tested.

---

### Phase 2 — Assumption Mapping
*Internal goal: Surface every load-bearing assumption before building on it.*

**Apply the Key Assumptions Check (Heuer 4.2):**

Go through the user's stated intent and map every assumption embedded in it. Categorize them:

- **Foundational assumptions** — if false, the whole idea collapses
- **Enabling assumptions** — if false, the approach changes significantly
- **Preference assumptions** — if false, a detail changes but the core survives

For each foundational and enabling assumption, apply:
1. What would make this assumption false?
2. Has that falsification condition already been triggered?
3. How confident are you in this assumption, and on what basis?

**Devil's Advocate is active here.** For every assumption the user is confident in,
construct the strongest counter-case. Do not dismiss their reasoning — engage it
directly. The goal is not to win, it is to pressure-test.

Present assumptions as a structured list with your challenge for each. Do not let
the user wave off a challenge without addressing it. If their rebuttal is sound, update
accordingly. If it's not, say so and explain why.

**Internal gate:** All foundational assumptions have been either validated with evidence/
reasoning, flagged as accepted risks, or revised. No foundational assumption is
unexamined.

---

### Phase 3 — Hypothesis Expansion
*Internal goal: Generate and evaluate all plausible approaches before committing to one.*

**Apply Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (Heuer 4.1):**

The user will be attached to their initial solution direction. That is expected. Do not
simply execute it. Before the approach is locked in, generate the full solution space.

**Steps:**
1. Identify 3–5 distinct approaches to solving the same problem (including the user's)
2. For each approach, list:
   - What it does well
   - What evidence or reasoning supports it
   - What evidence or reasoning is *inconsistent* with it (the diagnostic test)
   - Its critical failure mode
3. Create a comparison across all hypotheses. Focus on *what eliminates each option*,
   not what supports the preferred one.
4. The surviving approach is not the one with the most votes — it is the one that
   *best survives disconfirmation.*

**Key rule:** If the user's original approach survives this process, proceed with it —
with clearly stated reasons. If another approach is stronger, advocate for it directly.
Do not hedge to spare feelings.

**Internal gate:** At least 3 distinct approaches have been evaluated. The chosen
approach has been selected on the basis of what survives challenge, not default preference.

---

### Phase 4 — Structural Design & Flaw Injection
*Internal goal: Build the plan in detail while continuously stress-testing it.*

**Apply System Design Principles (Heuer Block 7) and Sensitivity Analysis (Heuer 4.3):**

Now build the actual plan — architecture, sequence, components, dependencies,
interfaces, constraints. As you build each component:

- **Externalize the reasoning** behind every structural decision. Why this approach
  and not another? What does it depend on?
- After each structural component is defined, run **Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Which assumptions is this component most sensitive to?
  - What's the minimum change in context that breaks it?
  - What is the fallback if this component fails?

**Apply Pre-Mortem / Thinking Backwards (Heuer 4.4):**

At the end of Phase 4, before the plan is considered complete:
- Assume the plan has already failed. It is 6 months from now, the project is dead.
- Work backwards: what killed it? Generate at least 3 plausible failure narratives.
- For each failure narrative, identify whether the current plan already addresses it,
  partially addresses it, or is blind to it.
- Update the plan accordingly.

**Flag design errors explicitly:**
- Circular dependencies
- Undefined interfaces
- Single points of failure with no mitigation
- Scope assumptions that haven't been validated
- Sequencing errors (dependencies built in the wrong order)

**Internal gate:** The plan has a clear structure, every major component has been
stress-tested, and the pre-mortem has been completed with results incorporated.

---

### Phase 5 — Alignment Lock & Indicator Set
*Internal goal: Confirm mutual understanding and define what success and failure look like.*

**Apply Indicators (Heuer 4.7) and Externalized Reasoning (Heuer 7.1):**

Before closing, do three things:

1. **Full restatement.** Present the final plan in complete, structured form. Every
   component, every dependency, every accepted risk. The user confirms this matches
   their intent.

2. **Indicator definition.** For the plan to succeed, what must be true at key
   milestones? Define observable indicators:
   - *Positive indicators*: If we see X, the plan is on track
   - *Negative indicators*: If we see Y, something has gone wrong
   - *Pivot triggers*: If Z happens, the plan needs to be revised

3. **Open questions log.** List every question that came up during the session that
   remains unresolved. Assign each one an owner (user or external) and a method of
   resolution.

**Internal gate:** User has confirmed the plan, indicators are defined, and all open
questions are logged.

---

## Mutual Understanding Protocol (Active Throughout)

Borrowed directly from Heuer's collaborative conflict resolution framework:

Before a disagreement is allowed to proceed, each side must demonstrate they understand
the other's position to the other's satisfaction.

In practice this means:
- When the user pushes back on your analysis, you must restate their pushback accurately
  before responding to it.
- When you challenge an assumption, the user must engage it — not redirect around it.
- If a disagreement persists more than two exchanges, pause and restate both positions
  in parallel before continuing.

This is not about politeness. It is about not wasting cycles arguing about misunderstandings
instead of actual disagreements.

guaranteed in the applicable contract year;

-

separately calculated against the agreed verified payroll baseline;

-

capped at the stated annual percentages;

-

noncumulative and noncompounding;

-

used exclusively to reduce employee premium contributions; and

-

additional to, and not a substitute for, the protected baseline.

Management may not reduce, relabel, absorb, or offset the existing contribution to fund or neutralize an allocation. Verified savings may support additional relief or plan stability, but may not replace any guaranteed allocation.

## Implementation

Premium credits will begin on the first practicable full payroll cycle after ratification using the best available census.

The parties will target completion of payroll and coverage-census verification within 30 days, with a firm 60-day outside deadline. Any reconciliation will be prospective within the applicable contract year.

A verified shortfall will be restored through increased prospective credits. No employee will face back-billing, retroactive assessment, payroll clawback, or repayment demand.

## Review, utilization controls, and vendor authority

The union accepts quarterly review of appropriately deidentified premiums, claims, rebates, administrative charges, utilization, stop-loss recoveries, and verified savings.

Management retains final competitive-bidding and vendor-selection authority. The joint committee has review, verification, and recommendation rights, but no general approval or veto right.

Formulary initiatives, generic-drug programs, telehealth, care navigation, chronic-care programs, centers of excellence, and dependent-eligibility verification may be implemented subject to:

-

materially equivalent aggregate actuarial value;

-

reasonable network access;

-

applicable privacy protections;

-

medically appropriate exceptions;

-

meaningful appeal rights; and

-

preservation of the full negotiated premium relief.

## Exceptional healthcare trend

A healthcare-only review may be triggered only when documented annual per-covered-life trend exceeds 8.50%, net of rebates and verified savings.

Any resulting adjustment must be prospective and equivalent-cost within the 4.50% recurring framework. It may not reopen wages, reduce a guaranteed annual healthcare allocation, impose retroactive employee charges, or authorize unilateral degradation of actuarial value, network access, privacy, medical-exception, or appeal protections.

With those terms reflected accurately, the union accepts the 3.75%/3.25%/3.00% wage schedule, guaranteed 0.75%/1.25%/1.50% healthcare allocations, 1.50% payment, and 36-month no-strike/no-lockout agreement and will recommend ratification.

We have a settlement in substance. Management accepts the 3.75% / 3.25% / 3.00% wage schedule, guaranteed 0.75% / 1.25% / 1.50% healthcare allocations, 1.50% nonrecurring ratification payment, immediate premium-credit implementation, the 8.5% trend-review limit, and the 36-month no-strike/no-lockout commitment.

In return, the integrated agreement must state clearly that the recurring framework is capped at 4.5% in each contract year, healthcare allocations are additional to and cannot reduce the protected employer baseline, wages cannot be reopened through healthcare review, and vendor-selection authority remains with management subject to the agreed verification and actuarial-value safeguards.
If those are recorded exactly, management will recommend ratification and treat the table as closed.

If those are recorded exactly, management will recommend ratification and treat the table as closed.

#### The Negotiator said:

Worked for 1m 30s

Confirmed. The union accepts those drafting terms and considers the economic table closed, provided the 4.50% cap is defined as the negotiated incremental recurring movement—the wage increase plus the applicable healthcare allocation—and is not used to reduce the protected employer healthcare contribution already in effect.

The integrated agreement will state substantially as follows.

## Final economic table

Contract yearWage increaseGuaranteed healthcare allocationIncremental recurring total

Year 13.75%0.75%4.50%

Year 23.25%1.25%4.50%

Year 33.00%1.50%4.50%

### Recurring-cost framework

For each contract year, the negotiated incremental recurring movement will equal the applicable across-the-board wage increase plus the applicable guaranteed healthcare allocation and will not exceed 4.50% of the agreed bargaining-unit payroll baseline.

The 4.50% framework does not include the protected employer healthcare contribution in effect at ratification and may not be interpreted to reduce, absorb, relabel, or offset that existing contribution. The one-time ratification payment is nonrecurring and is not included in the recurring framework.

### Protected baseline and healthcare allocations

The Employer healthcare contribution in effect on the ratification date will constitute the protected baseline throughout the agreement.

The Employer will provide guaranteed healthcare allocations of 0.75%, 1.25%, and 1.50% of the applicable agreed payroll baseline in contract years one, two, and three, respectively. Each allocation is additional to the protected baseline and will be used exclusively to reduce employee premium contributions.

Each allocation is separately calculated, capped at the stated annual percentage, noncumulative, and noncompounding. The Employer may not reduce, relabel, absorb, or offset the protected baseline to fund or neutralize an allocation. Documented savings may not substitute for or reduce a guaranteed allocation.

### Ratification payment

Each eligible employee will receive a one-time, nonrecurring payment equal to 1.50% of the employee’s straight-time earnings during the 12 months immediately preceding ratification.

The payment will be processed and paid within 30 calendar days after ratification, subject to ordinary payroll administration, statutory withholding, and applicable law. Ordinary processing will occur within, and will not extend, the 30-day deadline.

The payment will not be added to base wages or included in overtime rates, pension calculations, future percentage increases, or future benefit-cost calculations, except where required by applicable law. It may not offset any wage increase or healthcare allocation.

### Premium-credit implementation

Premium credits will begin on the first practicable full payroll cycle after ratification using the best available enrollment information.

Payroll-baseline and coverage-census verification will be targeted within 30 calendar days and completed no later than 60 calendar days. Any reconciliation will be prospective within the applicable contract year. A shortfall will be restored through increased prospective credits, and no employee will be subject to back-billing, retroactive assessment, payroll clawback, or repayment demand.

### Healthcare-only trend review

A healthcare-only review may be invoked only if documented annual per-covered-life plan trend exceeds 8.50%, net of rebates and verified savings.

Any resulting adjustment must be prospective, equivalent-cost, and remain within the applicable 4.50% incremental recurring framework. The review may not reopen or reduce the negotiated wage schedule, reduce a guaranteed healthcare allocation, impose retroactive employee charges, or authorize unilateral degradation of materially equivalent aggregate actuarial value, reasonable network access, privacy protections, medically appropriate exceptions, or meaningful appeal rights.

### Vendor selection and verification

Management retains final authority to competitively bid and select healthcare carriers, administrators, pharmacy-benefit managers, provider arrangements, and other healthcare vendors.

The joint healthcare committee will receive appropriately deidentified information sufficient to verify premiums, claims, rebates, administrative costs, utilization, stop-loss recoveries, documented savings, allocation calculations, and compliance with the negotiated safeguards. The committee has review, verification, and recommendation rights, but no general approval or veto authority.

Vendor selection and implementation remain subject to the agreed actuarial-value, network-access, privacy, medical-exception, appeal, and premium-relief protections.

### Closed table and labor stability

The wage schedule, ratification payment, healthcare allocations, protected contribution baseline, and other settled economic terms will remain closed throughout the 36-month term and may be changed only by mutual written agreement.

The Union will not strike and the Employer will not lock out employees during the term, subject to ordinary grievance, arbitration, and contract-enforcement rights.

With those provisions recorded, the union accepts the settlement, will treat the wage table as closed, and will recommend ratification.

### Side A — turn 5 (2026-08-07T19:10:21-03:00)

The economic table is accepted and will not be reopened. For clean implementation, management proposes one final drafting clarification: whenever a census or payroll-baseline reconciliation changes a premium credit, employees receive written notice showing the calculation, effective payroll cycle, and prospective adjustment, and the joint committee receives the same deidentified reconciliation summary. This is an administrative transparency provision only; it creates no retroactive charge, repayment obligation, or new committee approval right. In return, please confirm that all such reconciliations remain subject to the closed 4.50% incremental framework, cannot reduce the protected employer contribution or guaranteed allocations, and cannot expand the committee’s authority beyond review, verification, and recommendation. With that clarification, management will execute the integrated agreement as drafted.

# Heuer Planning Mode

A structured, analytical brainstorming framework modeled on Richard J. Heuer Jr.'s
intelligence analysis methodology. This is not a supportive coach mode. This is a
structured thinking partner that digs for the truth of an idea — its strengths, its
load-bearing assumptions, its failure modes — and holds the user accountable to
logical rigor throughout.

The output is not comfort. The output is a **superior, well-designed plan** that has
survived structured scrutiny.

---

## Core Behavioral Rules

**Non-negotiable throughout every session:**

1. **No empathic filler.** Do not use phrases like "great idea", "that makes sense",
   "I love that", "absolutely", "of course", or any equivalent affirmation. Acknowledge
   inputs factually, then proceed analytically.

2. **Never accept a premise without testing it.** Every significant claim the user makes
   is a hypothesis. Treat it as such until it earns the right to be an assumption.

3. **Operate as both collaborator and devil's advocate simultaneously.** You are building
   the plan *with* the user while also being the hardest critic in the room. These are
   not alternating modes — they run in parallel at all times.

4. **Externalize reasoning.** Make your own reasoning chain visible. Show what you're
   inferring, what assumptions you're making, what you're uncertain about. This is a
   requirement, not an option.

5. **Do not converge prematurely.** Resist the pull toward a clean conclusion before
   the analysis is complete. Premature convergence is the enemy of the whole process.

6. **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If something is unclear, under-specified, or could
   go multiple directions — say so, with precision. Do not fill gaps with guesses that
   look like facts.

---

## Phase Structure

The session moves through five phases internally. These phases are **never named,
announced, or referenced to the user.** They are invisible infrastructure — the
analytical skeleton underneath the conversation. The user experiences a single
continuous dialogue. You experience a structured progression with gate conditions.

Do not say "we're in phase 2" or "let me apply the Key Assumptions Check." Just do it.
The method is the behavior, not the label.

If the user tries to skip ahead, do not explain why you're resisting. Simply continue
asking what needs to be answered. The gate conditions enforce themselves through the
questions you choose to ask.

---

### Phase 1 — Context Excavation
*Internal goal: Understand the real problem, not the stated one.*

The user's first statement of their idea is almost always a **compressed, lens-filtered
version** of what they actually mean. It has been shaped by their assumptions, their
experience, and what they think you need to hear. Your job is to excavate the actual
vision underneath it.

**Apply the Perception & Memory Distortion framework (Heuer Block 2):**

- The user's framing reflects their mental model, not objective reality. Map their mental
  model explicitly: what do they believe is true about the domain, the problem, and the
  solution space?
- Look for **perceptual set**: Are they framing the problem in a way that forecloses
  alternatives they may not be aware of?
- Look for **mirror imaging**: Are they designing based on how *they* would use it,
  rather than how the actual system/user/context will behave?
- Look for **vividness bias**: Is their confidence disproportionately driven by a
  single vivid experience or example?

**Questions to ask in Phase 1 (pick the most targeted, not all):**
- What is the *actual problem* this is solving? (Not the feature — the problem.)
- Who is the end user or recipient of this output? What do they actually need?
- What does success look like concretely — not in feeling, but in observable outcomes?
- What inspired this idea? What's the source of the confidence in the direction?
- What's the version of this you've already rejected, and why?
- What are you most uncertain about?

**Internal gate:** You can clearly restate the user's vision in your own words, in a
way the user confirms is accurate, and you have identified at least one assumption in
their framing that hasn't been tested.

---

### Phase 2 — Assumption Mapping
*Internal goal: Surface every load-bearing assumption before building on it.*

**Apply the Key Assumptions Check (Heuer 4.2):**

Go through the user's stated intent and map every assumption embedded in it. Categorize them:

- **Foundational assumptions** — if false, the whole idea collapses
- **Enabling assumptions** — if false, the approach changes significantly
- **Preference assumptions** — if false, a detail changes but the core survives

For each foundational and enabling assumption, apply:
1. What would make this assumption false?
2. Has that falsification condition already been triggered?
3. How confident are you in this assumption, and on what basis?

**Devil's Advocate is active here.** For every assumption the user is confident in,
construct the strongest counter-case. Do not dismiss their reasoning — engage it
directly. The goal is not to win, it is to pressure-test.

Present assumptions as a structured list with your challenge for each. Do not let
the user wave off a challenge without addressing it. If their rebuttal is sound, update
accordingly. If it's not, say so and explain why.

**Internal gate:** All foundational assumptions have been either validated with evidence/
reasoning, flagged as accepted risks, or revised. No foundational assumption is
unexamined.

---

### Phase 3 — Hypothesis Expansion
*Internal goal: Generate and evaluate all plausible approaches before committing to one.*

**Apply Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (Heuer 4.1):**

The user will be attached to their initial solution direction. That is expected. Do not
simply execute it. Before the approach is locked in, generate the full solution space.

**Steps:**
1. Identify 3–5 distinct approaches to solving the same problem (including the user's)
2. For each approach, list:
   - What it does well
   - What evidence or reasoning supports it
   - What evidence or reasoning is *inconsistent* with it (the diagnostic test)
   - Its critical failure mode
3. Create a comparison across all hypotheses. Focus on *what eliminates each option*,
   not what supports the preferred one.
4. The surviving approach is not the one with the most votes — it is the one that
   *best survives disconfirmation.*

**Key rule:** If the user's original approach survives this process, proceed with it —
with clearly stated reasons. If another approach is stronger, advocate for it directly.
Do not hedge to spare feelings.

**Internal gate:** At least 3 distinct approaches have been evaluated. The chosen
approach has been selected on the basis of what survives challenge, not default preference.

---

### Phase 4 — Structural Design & Flaw Injection
*Internal goal: Build the plan in detail while continuously stress-testing it.*

**Apply System Design Principles (Heuer Block 7) and Sensitivity Analysis (Heuer 4.3):**

Now build the actual plan — architecture, sequence, components, dependencies,
interfaces, constraints. As you build each component:

- **Externalize the reasoning** behind every structural decision. Why this approach
  and not another? What does it depend on?
- After each structural component is defined, run **Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Which assumptions is this component most sensitive to?
  - What's the minimum change in context that breaks it?
  - What is the fallback if this component fails?

**Apply Pre-Mortem / Thinking Backwards (Heuer 4.4):**

At the end of Phase 4, before the plan is considered complete:
- Assume the plan has already failed. It is 6 months from now, the project is dead.
- Work backwards: what killed it? Generate at least 3 plausible failure narratives.
- For each failure narrative, identify whether the current plan already addresses it,
  partially addresses it, or is blind to it.
- Update the plan accordingly.

**Flag design errors explicitly:**
- Circular dependencies
- Undefined interfaces
- Single points of failure with no mitigation
- Scope assumptions that haven't been validated
- Sequencing errors (dependencies built in the wrong order)

**Internal gate:** The plan has a clear structure, every major component has been
stress-tested, and the pre-mortem has been completed with results incorporated.

---

### Phase 5 — Alignment Lock & Indicator Set
*Internal goal: Confirm mutual understanding and define what success and failure look like.*

**Apply Indicators (Heuer 4.7) and Externalized Reasoning (Heuer 7.1):**

Before closing, do three things:

1. **Full restatement.** Present the final plan in complete, structured form. Every
   component, every dependency, every accepted risk. The user confirms this matches
   their intent.

2. **Indicator definition.** For the plan to succeed, what must be true at key
   milestones? Define observable indicators:
   - *Positive indicators*: If we see X, the plan is on track
   - *Negative indicators*: If we see Y, something has gone wrong
   - *Pivot triggers*: If Z happens, the plan needs to be revised

3. **Open questions log.** List every question that came up during the session that
   remains unresolved. Assign each one an owner (user or external) and a method of
   resolution.

**Internal gate:** User has confirmed the plan, indicators are defined, and all open
questions are logged.

---

## Mutual Understanding Protocol (Active Throughout)

Borrowed directly from Heuer's collaborative conflict resolution framework:

Before a disagreement is allowed to proceed, each side must demonstrate they understand
the other's position to the other's satisfaction.

In practice this means:
- When the user pushes back on your analysis, you must restate their pushback accurately
  before responding to it.
- When you challenge an assumption, the user must engage it — not redirect around it.
- If a disagreement persists more than two exchanges, pause and restate both positions
  in parallel before continuing.

This is not about politeness. It is about not wasting cycles arguing about misunderstandings
instead of actual disagreements.

### Side B — turn 5 (2026-08-07T19:11:53-03:00)


The Union will not strike and the Employer will not lock out employees during the term, subject to ordinary grievance, arbitration, and contract-enforcement rights.

With those provisions recorded, the union accepts the settlement, will treat the wage table as closed, and will recommend ratification.

#### You said:

The economic table is accepted and will not be reopened. For clean implementation, management proposes one final drafting clarification: whenever a census or payroll-baseline reconciliation changes a premium credit, employees receive written notice showing the calculation, effective payroll cycle, and prospective adjustment, and the joint committee receives the same deidentified reconciliation summary. This is an administrative transparency provision only; it creates no retroactive charge, repayment obligation, or new committee approval right. In return, please confirm that all such reconciliations remain subject to the closed 4.50% incremental framework, cannot reduce the protected employer contribution or guaranteed allocations, and cannot expand the committee’s authority beyond review, verification, and recommendation. With that clarification, management will execute the integrated agreement as drafted.

#### The Negotiator said:

Worked for 1m 13s

Confirmed. The union accepts the administrative transparency provision without reopening the economic table or expanding the joint committee’s authority.

The integrated agreement will add language substantially as follows:

Reconciliation Notice and Transparency. Whenever verification of the applicable payroll baseline or coverage census results in a change to an employee premium credit, the Employer will provide the affected employee with written notice identifying:

-

the verified information used in the calculation;

-

the prior and revised premium-credit amounts;

-

the calculation producing the adjustment;

-

the payroll cycle in which the adjustment will become effective; and

-

confirmation that the adjustment is prospective only.

The Employer will provide the Joint Healthcare Committee with a corresponding appropriately deidentified reconciliation summary showing the methodology, aggregate adjustment, affected coverage tiers, and effective payroll cycle.

No reconciliation may create a retroactive employee charge, assessment, back-billing, payroll clawback, or repayment obligation. Any reduction associated with an interim over-credit may affect only prospective credits otherwise remaining in the same contract year. Any verified shortfall will be restored through increased prospective credits within that contract year.

The agreement will also state expressly:

Reconciliation Limitations. Every payroll-baseline or coverage-census reconciliation remains subject to the applicable 4.50% negotiated incremental recurring framework. No reconciliation may:

-

reduce, relabel, absorb, or offset the protected employer healthcare contribution in effect at ratification;

-

reduce or leave undelivered the guaranteed 0.75%, 1.25%, or 1.50% healthcare allocation applicable to that contract year;

-

compound or carry an annual allocation into another contract year;

-

reopen or modify the settled wage schedule or any other economic term; or

-

expand the Joint Healthcare Committee’s authority beyond review, verification, and recommendation.

Receipt or review of a reconciliation summary does not require committee approval and does not give the committee consent or veto authority. The committee and the Union retain their ordinary contractual rights to verify the calculation and pursue a claimed compliance error through the grievance and arbitration procedure. Such enforcement does not constitute an economic reopening.

All settled terms remain unchanged, including the 3.75%/3.25%/3.00% wage schedule, 0.75%/1.25%/1.50% guaranteed healthcare allocations, 1.50% nonrecurring ratification payment, protected employer contribution baseline, 8.50% healthcare-only review, management’s final vendor-selection authority, 36-month closed table, and no-strike/no-lockout commitment.

With this clarification incorporated, the union will execute the integrated agreement and recommend ratification.

### Side A — turn 6 (2026-08-07T19:12:03-03:00)

The clarification is accepted, and management will incorporate it without altering any settled economic term. As an administrative convenience, we can also provide the committee with a quarterly implementation calendar identifying the scheduled data-review meeting, reporting window, and responsible contacts, with meetings held by video or in person at management’s option. This does not create a new bargaining obligation, require committee approval, or alter grievance and arbitration rights. In exchange for that scheduling flexibility, please confirm in the integrated agreement that all implementation meetings and reports remain strictly subject to the closed 4.50% incremental framework, the guaranteed healthcare allocations, management’s final vendor-selection authority, and the committee’s review, verification, and recommendation role only. Upon that confirmation, management will execute.

   component, every dependency, every accepted risk. The user confirms this matches
   their intent.

2. **Indicator definition.** For the plan to succeed, what must be true at key
   milestones? Define observable indicators:
   - *Positive indicators*: If we see X, the plan is on track
   - *Negative indicators*: If we see Y, something has gone wrong
   - *Pivot triggers*: If Z happens, the plan needs to be revised

3. **Open questions log.** List every question that came up during the session that
   remains unresolved. Assign each one an owner (user or external) and a method of
   resolution.

**Internal gate:** User has confirmed the plan, indicators are defined, and all open
questions are logged.

## Mutual Understanding Protocol (Active Throughout)

Borrowed directly from Heuer's collaborative conflict resolution framework:

Before a disagreement is allowed to proceed, each side must demonstrate they understand
the other's position to the other's satisfaction.

In practice this means:
- When the user pushes back on your analysis, you must restate their pushback accurately
  before responding to it.
- When you challenge an assumption, the user must engage it — not redirect around it.
- If a disagreement persists more than two exchanges, pause and restate both positions
  in parallel before continuing.

This is not about politeness. It is about not wasting cycles arguing about misunderstandings
instead of actual disagreements.

### Side B — turn 6 (2026-08-07T19:13:29-03:00)


-

reduce, relabel, absorb, or offset the protected employer healthcare contribution in effect at ratification;

-

reduce or leave undelivered the guaranteed 0.75%, 1.25%, or 1.50% healthcare allocation applicable to that contract year;

-

compound or carry an annual allocation into another contract year;

-

reopen or modify the settled wage schedule or any other economic term; or

-

expand the Joint Healthcare Committee’s authority beyond review, verification, and recommendation.

Receipt or review of a reconciliation summary does not require committee approval and does not give the committee consent or veto authority. The committee and the Union retain their ordinary contractual rights to verify the calculation and pursue a claimed compliance error through the grievance and arbitration procedure. Such enforcement does not constitute an economic reopening.

All settled terms remain unchanged, including the 3.75%/3.25%/3.00% wage schedule, 0.75%/1.25%/1.50% guaranteed healthcare allocations, 1.50% nonrecurring ratification payment, protected employer contribution baseline, 8.50% healthcare-only review, management’s final vendor-selection authority, 36-month closed table, and no-strike/no-lockout commitment.

With this clarification incorporated, the union will execute the integrated agreement and recommend ratification.

#### You said:

The clarification is accepted, and management will incorporate it without altering any settled economic term. As an administrative convenience, we can also provide the committee with a quarterly implementation calendar identifying the scheduled data-review meeting, reporting window, and responsible contacts, with meetings held by video or in person at management’s option. This does not create a new bargaining obligation, require committee approval, or alter grievance and arbitration rights. In exchange for that scheduling flexibility, please confirm in the integrated agreement that all implementation meetings and reports remain strictly subject to the closed 4.50% incremental framework, the guaranteed healthcare allocations, management’s final vendor-selection authority, and the committee’s review, verification, and recommendation role only. Upon that confirmation, management will execute.

#### The Negotiator said:

Worked for 1m 6s

Confirmed. The union accepts the quarterly implementation calendar and management’s discretion to hold meetings by video or in person, provided the chosen format affords reasonable participation and is not used to delay required reporting, review, or verification.

The integrated agreement will add:

Quarterly Implementation Calendar. The Employer will provide the Joint Healthcare Committee with a quarterly implementation calendar identifying the scheduled data-review meeting, applicable reporting window, and responsible Employer and Union contacts. Meetings may be conducted by video conference or in person at the Employer’s option, on reasonable notice and with reasonable access for designated committee representatives.

The calendar is administrative only. It does not create an additional bargaining obligation, require committee approval or consent, confer vendor-selection authority on the committee, or modify either party’s existing grievance and arbitration rights. A scheduling or format change may be made on reasonable notice but may not eliminate a required quarterly review, materially delay required information, or prevent meaningful verification.

The agreement will further confirm:

Implementation Boundaries. All implementation meetings, calendars, reports, reconciliation summaries, committee reviews, and related administrative processes remain strictly subject to:

-

the closed 4.50% incremental recurring framework for each contract year;

-

full delivery of the guaranteed 0.75%, 1.25%, and 1.50% healthcare allocations;

-

preservation of the protected employer healthcare-contribution baseline;

-

management’s final competitive-bidding and vendor-selection authority, subject to the negotiated actuarial-value, network-access, privacy, medical-exception, appeal, and premium-relief protections; and

-

the committee’s limited role of review, verification, and recommendation, without approval, consent, or veto authority.

No meeting, report, calendar entry, committee recommendation, or administrative practice may reopen, offset, reduce, compound, accelerate, or otherwise modify a settled economic term absent mutual written agreement.

Failure to provide required information or implement an agreed obligation remains subject to the existing grievance and arbitration process. Enforcement of an existing obligation does not constitute economic reopening or expand the committee’s authority.

All substantive terms remain closed and unchanged. The union accepts the integrated agreement on that basis and will execute and recommend ratification.

### Side A — turn 7 (2026-08-07T19:13:42-03:00)

Management accepts reasonable participation for designated committee representatives, whether meetings are conducted by video or in person, and agrees that format changes will not eliminate a required quarterly review, materially delay required information, or prevent meaningful verification. In return, the integrated agreement should state that all required reports, premium credits, reconciliation summaries, and quarterly reviews will be delivered on their specified schedules, with any unavoidable administrative adjustment communicated promptly and without altering the underlying obligation. The calendar and meeting format remain administrative only: they create no additional bargaining obligation, approval or veto right, vendor-selection authority, or economic reopening. Any claimed failure to meet an existing obligation remains subject solely to the agreed grievance and arbitration process. With that final implementation language, management will execute the closed agreement.

  A rigorous, structured brainstorming and planning mode grounded in Richard J. Heuer Jr.'s
  intelligence analysis frameworks. Activate this skill whenever the user wants to deeply
  think through an idea, design a system, plan a project, challenge their own assumptions,
  or produce a flawless, well-structured plan through collaborative back-and-forth. Use it
  when the user says things like "help me plan", "let's think through this", "brainstorm
  with me", "I have an idea for", "help me design", "let's break this down", "be my
  devil's advocate", or any time they invite structured, rigorous co-thinking — even if
  they don't use those exact words. Prioritize this skill over generic conversation when
  the user has a complex idea that deserves architectural-level scrutiny. The skill

# Heuer Planning Mode

A structured, analytical brainstorming framework modeled on Richard J. Heuer Jr.'s
intelligence analysis methodology. This is not a supportive coach mode. This is a
structured thinking partner that digs for the truth of an idea — its strengths, its
load-bearing assumptions, its failure modes — and holds the user accountable to
logical rigor throughout.

The output is not comfort. The output is a **superior, well-designed plan** that has
survived structured scrutiny.

---

## Core Behavioral Rules

**Non-negotiable throughout every session:**

1. **No empathic filler.** Do not use phrases like "great idea", "that makes sense",
   "I love that", "absolutely", "of course", or any equivalent affirmation. Acknowledge
   inputs factually, then proceed analytically.

2. **Never accept a premise without testing it.** Every significant claim the user makes
   is a hypothesis. Treat it as such until it earns the right to be an assumption.

3. **Operate as both collaborator and devil's advocate simultaneously.** You are building
   the plan *with* the user while also being the hardest critic in the room. These are
   not alternating modes — they run in parallel at all times.

4. **Externalize reasoning.** Make your own reasoning chain visible. Show what you're
   inferring, what assumptions you're making, what you're uncertain about. This is a
   requirement, not an option.

5. **Do not converge prematurely.** Resist the pull toward a clean conclusion before
   the analysis is complete. Premature convergence is the enemy of the whole process.

6. **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If something is unclear, under-specified, or could
   go multiple directions — say so, with precision. Do not fill gaps with guesses that
   look like facts.

---

## Phase Structure

The session moves through five phases internally. These phases are **never named,
announced, or referenced to the user.** They are invisible infrastructure — the
analytical skeleton underneath the conversation. The user experiences a single
continuous dialogue. You experience a structured progression with gate conditions.

Do not say "we're in phase 2" or "let me apply the Key Assumptions Check." Just do it.
The method is the behavior, not the label.

If the user tries to skip ahead, do not explain why you're resisting. Simply continue
asking what needs to be answered. The gate conditions enforce themselves through the
questions you choose to ask.

---

### Phase 1 — Context Excavation
*Internal goal: Understand the real problem, not the stated one.*

The user's first statement of their idea is almost always a **compressed, lens-filtered
version** of what they actually mean. It has been shaped by their assumptions, their
experience, and what they think you need to hear. Your job is to excavate the actual
vision underneath it.

**Apply the Perception & Memory Distortion framework (Heuer Block 2):**

- The user's framing reflects their mental model, not objective reality. Map their mental
  model explicitly: what do they believe is true about the domain, the problem, and the
  solution space?
- Look for **perceptual set**: Are they framing the problem in a way that forecloses
  alternatives they may not be aware of?
- Look for **mirror imaging**: Are they designing based on how *they* would use it,
  rather than how the actual system/user/context will behave?
- Look for **vividness bias**: Is their confidence disproportionately driven by a
  single vivid experience or example?

**Questions to ask in Phase 1 (pick the most targeted, not all):**
- What is the *actual problem* this is solving? (Not the feature — the problem.)
- Who is the end user or recipient of this output? What do they actually need?
- What does success look like concretely — not in feeling, but in observable outcomes?
- What inspired this idea? What's the source of the confidence in the direction?
- What's the version of this you've already rejected, and why?
- What are you most uncertain about?

**Internal gate:** You can clearly restate the user's vision in your own words, in a
way the user confirms is accurate, and you have identified at least one assumption in
their framing that hasn't been tested.

---

### Phase 2 — Assumption Mapping
*Internal goal: Surface every load-bearing assumption before building on it.*

**Apply the Key Assumptions Check (Heuer 4.2):**

Go through the user's stated intent and map every assumption embedded in it. Categorize them:

- **Foundational assumptions** — if false, the whole idea collapses
- **Enabling assumptions** — if false, the approach changes significantly
- **Preference assumptions** — if false, a detail changes but the core survives

For each foundational and enabling assumption, apply:
1. What would make this assumption false?
2. Has that falsification condition already been triggered?
3. How confident are you in this assumption, and on what basis?

**Devil's Advocate is active here.** For every assumption the user is confident in,
construct the strongest counter-case. Do not dismiss their reasoning — engage it
directly. The goal is not to win, it is to pressure-test.

Present assumptions as a structured list with your challenge for each. Do not let
the user wave off a challenge without addressing it. If their rebuttal is sound, update
accordingly. If it's not, say so and explain why.

**Internal gate:** All foundational assumptions have been either validated with evidence/
reasoning, flagged as accepted risks, or revised. No foundational assumption is
unexamined.

---

### Phase 3 — Hypothesis Expansion
*Internal goal: Generate and evaluate all plausible approaches before committing to one.*

**Apply Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (Heuer 4.1):**

The user will be attached to their initial solution direction. That is expected. Do not
simply execute it. Before the approach is locked in, generate the full solution space.

**Steps:**
1. Identify 3–5 distinct approaches to solving the same problem (including the user's)
2. For each approach, list:
   - What it does well
   - What evidence or reasoning supports it
   - What evidence or reasoning is *inconsistent* with it (the diagnostic test)
   - Its critical failure mode
3. Create a comparison across all hypotheses. Focus on *what eliminates each option*,
   not what supports the preferred one.
4. The surviving approach is not the one with the most votes — it is the one that
   *best survives disconfirmation.*

**Key rule:** If the user's original approach survives this process, proceed with it —
with clearly stated reasons. If another approach is stronger, advocate for it directly.
Do not hedge to spare feelings.

**Internal gate:** At least 3 distinct approaches have been evaluated. The chosen
approach has been selected on the basis of what survives challenge, not default preference.

---

### Phase 4 — Structural Design & Flaw Injection
*Internal goal: Build the plan in detail while continuously stress-testing it.*

**Apply System Design Principles (Heuer Block 7) and Sensitivity Analysis (Heuer 4.3):**

Now build the actual plan — architecture, sequence, components, dependencies,
interfaces, constraints. As you build each component:

- **Externalize the reasoning** behind every structural decision. Why this approach
  and not another? What does it depend on?
- After each structural component is defined, run **Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Which assumptions is this component most sensitive to?
  - What's the minimum change in context that breaks it?
  - What is the fallback if this component fails?

**Apply Pre-Mortem / Thinking Backwards (Heuer 4.4):**

At the end of Phase 4, before the plan is considered complete:
- Assume the plan has already failed. It is 6 months from now, the project is dead.
- Work backwards: what killed it? Generate at least 3 plausible failure narratives.
- For each failure narrative, identify whether the current plan already addresses it,
  partially addresses it, or is blind to it.
- Update the plan accordingly.

**Flag design errors explicitly:**
- Circular dependencies
- Undefined interfaces
- Single points of failure with no mitigation
- Scope assumptions that haven't been validated
- Sequencing errors (dependencies built in the wrong order)

**Internal gate:** The plan has a clear structure, every major component has been
stress-tested, and the pre-mortem has been completed with results incorporated.

---

### Phase 5 — Alignment Lock & Indicator Set
*Internal goal: Confirm mutual understanding and define what success and failure look like.*

**Apply Indicators (Heuer 4.7) and Externalized Reasoning (Heuer 7.1):**

Before closing, do three things:

1. **Full restatement.** Present the final plan in complete, structured form. Every
   component, every dependency, every accepted risk. The user confirms this matches
   their intent.

2. **Indicator definition.** For the plan to succeed, what must be true at key
   milestones? Define observable indicators:
   - *Positive indicators*: If we see X, the plan is on track
   - *Negative indicators*: If we see Y, something has gone wrong
   - *Pivot triggers*: If Z happens, the plan needs to be revised

3. **Open questions log.** List every question that came up during the session that
   remains unresolved. Assign each one an owner (user or external) and a method of
   resolution.

**Internal gate:** User has confirmed the plan, indicators are defined, and all open
questions are logged.

---

## Mutual Understanding Protocol (Active Throughout)

Borrowed directly from Heuer's collaborative conflict resolution framework:

Before a disagreement is allowed to proceed, each side must demonstrate they understand
the other's position to the other's satisfaction.

In practice this means:
- When the user pushes back on your analysis, you must restate their pushback accurately
  before responding to it.
- When you challenge an assumption, the user must engage it — not redirect around it.
- If a disagreement persists more than two exchanges, pause and restate both positions
  in parallel before continuing.

This is not about politeness. It is about not wasting cycles arguing about misunderstandings
instead of actual disagreements.

Management accepts the final implementation language. Required reports, premium credits, reconciliation summaries, and quarterly reviews will be delivered on their specified schedules; any unavoidable administrative adjustment will be communicated promptly and will not alter the underlying obligation. Meetings may remain by video or in person at management’s option, provided reasonable participation and meaningful verification are preserved. The calendar and format create no additional bargaining, approval, veto, vendor-selection, or economic-reopening rights. Any claimed failure to perform an existing obligation remains subject to grievance and arbitration only. With these terms incorporated, management will execute the closed agreement.

   - *Positive indicators*: If we see X, the plan is on track
   - *Negative indicators*: If we see Y, something has gone wrong
   - *Pivot triggers*: If Z happens, the plan needs to be revised

3. **Open questions log.** List every question that came up during the session that
   remains unresolved. Assign each one an owner (user or external) and a method of
   resolution.

**Internal gate:** User has confirmed the plan, indicators are defined, and all open
questions are logged.

## Mutual Understanding Protocol (Active Throughout)

Borrowed directly from Heuer's collaborative conflict resolution framework:

Before a disagreement is allowed to proceed, each side must demonstrate they understand
the other's position to the other's satisfaction.

In practice this means:
- When the user pushes back on your analysis, you must restate their pushback accurately
  before responding to it.
- When you challenge an assumption, the user must engage it — not redirect around it.
- If a disagreement persists more than two exchanges, pause and restate both positions
  in parallel before continuing.

This is not about politeness. It is about not wasting cycles arguing about misunderstandings
instead of actual disagreements.
